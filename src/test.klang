//this is a comment- obviously. the language will start running from the first line.
//klang is staticly typed and is interpreted using rust.
//In Klang, although indentations are not mandatory, it is strongly recommended to adhere to formal indentation rules to maintain clean and readable code.
//klang has 4 simple types: bool, float, int, string. chars will just be stored inside strings
// var declaration:
//let identifier: type = value(?);
let x: int = 3;
// control flow:
//klang uses <, >, <=, >=, ==, &&, || for control flow. and will use the basic +, -, *, / for arithmatic operations.
//if bool && bool || bool {
//    expr;
//} else if bool {
//    expr;
//}
if x > 1 {
    x = 2;
