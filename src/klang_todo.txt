uh we can start by making a compiler and vm.
then uh maybe we can create some native functions and an std.
std lib will contain: advanced types, advanced math functions, random functions, time functions, file functions.
once we do that we can uh possibly uh add break and continue to loops, also a switch would be cool.
once we manage that, maybe some structs but i dont think we should go for traits.
also enums would be hella cool but it sounds super hard.
